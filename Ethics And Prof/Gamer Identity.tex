\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What Is a Gamer?}
To first look at whether game developers should be responsible for the fragmentation of gamr identities we must first look at the definition of a "Gamer" this sort of definition is central to studying video game culture \cite{shaw2010video}. The common misonception of gamers being male, white teenage boys is wrong.\cite{shaw2010video}. Gneder is also a huge area of study on gamer identities where most studies are trying to find multiple ways to include girl gamers where the media accept that "boys" and "girls" have different play styles. In turn this should supposedly make video game culture more accessible to female gamers.\cite{cassell2000barbie}
